Customer churn is the term used to describe when customers end their relationship or subscription with a company or service provider. Churn affects businesses’ revenue, growth, and customer loyalty. By studying churn and its related features, companies can create ways to keep existing customers, make them happier, and lower churn rates. They can also use predictive models to anticipate and prevent future churn, and take action to keep customers who are likely to leave.
